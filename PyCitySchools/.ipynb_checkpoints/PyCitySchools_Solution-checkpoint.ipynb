    "#This data analysis captures the performance of students in the subjects of maths and reading, summarises potential causative factors and contrasts them across other high schools in the local government area. \n",
    "#There were 15 schools and 39170 students included in this study. \n",
    "#The parameters evaluated included financial budget per student, school size (number of students), and school type (government or independent). \n",
    "#For analysis considering rates of ‘Passing’, a pass score was consider 50 or above. \n",
    "\n",
    "# One conclusion that can be derived from the data, is that a larger available budget per student does not correlate to better scores across maths and reading. \n",
    "#The budget allocation that saw the highest percent of overall passing students was $585-$630 per student, with an overall passing percentage of 79.88%. \n",
    "#The highest budget allocation bracket of $645-$680 had the lowest overall passing percentage at 66.75%, further supporting this conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Another conclusion that can be derived from the data, is that larger schools in terms of number of students, tend to perform worse than smaller schools across maths and reading. \n",
    "#The overall passing percentage was 79.06% for small schools (<1000 students), a slightly lower percentage of 78.04% for medium schools (1000-2000 students), and lower again at 70.29% for large schools (2000-5000 students). \n",
    "#Although it appears that size has a detrimental impact once a school is above 2000 in student number, it would be interesting to contrast this against a parameter such as ‘Number of Teaching Staff Employed per Student’ as this could be a hidden bias and true causative factor behind the performance statistics evaluated.\n"
